## Requirements
-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `node` (version 14.x)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   Your code should be `semistandard` compliant (version 16.x.x). [Rules of Standard](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/1T1yg1vOAChRN20Yyz8crw "Rules of Standard") + [semicolons on top](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/35q5Pc6A6KWPyd3kGeRQFg "semicolons on top"). Also as reference: [AirBnB style](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/ilo9MmB3u0utJZjZat-W3Q "AirBnB style")
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### Install Node 14

```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

```

### Install semi-standard

```
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global

```

Why JavaScript programming is amazing
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is used in a variety of contexts, including web development, server-side scripting, and desktop applications. It is known for its ease of use, dynamic typing, and ability to work with a wide range of web technologies.

### How to run a JavaScript script
To run a JavaScript script, you can use a web browser or a JavaScript interpreter. The interpreter can be installed on your computer or accessed online.

### How to create variables and constants
In JavaScript, you can create variables using the var, let, and const keywords. Variables created with var are function-scoped, while those created with let and const are block-scoped. const creates a variable that cannot be reassigned, while let allows for reassignment.

### What are differences between var, const, and let
The main difference between var, const, and let is their scoping behavior and mutability. var is function-scoped and can be reassigned, while let and const are block-scoped. const creates a variable that cannot be reassigned, while let allows for reassignment.

### What are all the data types available in JavaScript
JavaScript supports a range of data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, null, and undefined.

### How to use the if, if ... else statements
JavaScript provides the if and if...else statements for conditional logic. These statements allow you to execute certain code blocks based on whether or not a certain condition is true or false.

### How to use comments
Comments in JavaScript are used to provide explanations for code and make it more readable. They can be single-line comments using //, or multi-line comments using /* ... */.

### How to affect values to variables
In JavaScript, you can assign values to variables using the assignment operator =. For example, let myVar = 5; assigns the value 5 to the variable myVar.

### How to use while and for loops
Loops in JavaScript allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. The while loop and for loop are the most common types of loops used in JavaScript.

### How to use break and continue statements
The break and continue statements are used within loops to control the flow of the loop. break allows you to exit the loop early, while continue allows you to skip over certain iterations of the loop.

### What is a function and how do you use functions
Functions in JavaScript are blocks of code that can be called repeatedly throughout your code. They are defined using the function keyword and can take parameters and return values.

### What does a function that does not use any return statement return
If a function does not use any return statement, it will return undefined by default.

### Scope of variables
Variables in JavaScript have different scopes depending on how and where they are defined. Global variables have a global scope, while variables defined within a function have a local scope.

### What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
Arithmetic operators in JavaScript include +, -, *, /, and %. They are used to perform mathematical operations on values.

### How to manipulate dictionary
In JavaScript, a dictionary is called an object. Objects are collections of key-value pairs, and can be manipulated using various methods and properties.

### How to import a file
To import a file in JavaScript, you can use the import statement. However, this is only available in newer versions of JavaScript and in environments that support it, such as Node.js. In older versions of JavaScript, you can use the require statement to import files.
